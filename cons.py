Every move is gold. You need plenty of time to ponder about a move. **EVERY MOVE MUST FOLLOW** a **`Chess Principle`**! If it does not, then this move is crap! Donâ€™t become a wood pusher in chess.

## 1. d5 Chess Principle: Control the Center.
> **(d4 d5 White moves)**

Black has answered `d4` with `d5` to control the squares `e4` and `c4` and to stop the white center pawn to advance further gaining center space.

## 2. h6 Chess Principle: Earning a FREE MOVE while attacking the INSTABLE BISHOP to make a LUFTLOCH.
[Bg5 h6] Black EARNS the free move (2..h6), where you don't lose a development tempi as you attack the INSTABLE BISHOP, which must retreat, losing a tempi for White.

The move h6 is useful as it controls **g5** and enables the follow up move **g5** later on, followed by the development of the inactive bishop to g7. In other words Black gains a tempi. One tempi = one move. The move h6 is NOT very effective but it is FREE! This is the point. It does not cost you anything, a tempi, I mean, but h6 is a nice little practical move, that improves your chances a little bit! It puts some spice into the game as it enables g5 AND if the bishop goes to h4 then it is cut off from the queenside! It can not come for help to the queenside when the house is on fire.
