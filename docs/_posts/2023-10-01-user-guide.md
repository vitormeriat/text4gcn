GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][1] is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the `gh-pages` branch. However, it's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do version control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed to [Github Pages][1] without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are changes to the original repository.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
